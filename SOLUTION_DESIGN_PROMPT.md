**Act as a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Interviewer at a Big Tech company.**

I need a comprehensive **Solution Design** for the following DSA problem:

## Problem Description:
> [PASTE YOUR PROBLEM DESCRIPTION HERE]
> https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

**Preferred Language:** Kotlin

---

**Please structure your response exactly according to the following 5 stages:**

### 1. Clarification & Edge Cases:
* Identify key constraints (input size, data range, sorted vs unsorted).
* List potential edge cases (e.g., empty input, duplicates, negative numbers) that need to be handled.

### 2. High-Level Approach Analysis (Trade-offs):
* Briefly describe a **Brute Force** approach.
* Propose an **Optimized Approach** (Best Solution).
* **Compare them** specifically regarding Time Complexity (Big O) and Space Complexity. Explain *why* the optimized approach is better.

### 3. Algorithm Design:
* Explain the logic of the optimized solution step-by-step (without code yet).
* Mention specific Data Structures used (e.g., HashMap, Heap, Two Pointers) and why they were chosen.

### 4. Production-Ready Implementation:
* Write the code in **Kotlin**.
* Ensure the code is **clean, modular, and readable** (meaningful variable names).
* Include **Guard Clauses** to handle the edge cases identified in Step 1.
* Add comments explaining complex logic.

### 5. Verification & Complexity Finalization:
* **Dry Run:** Walk through the code with a small specific example input to verify correctness.
* State the final **Time** and **Space** complexity of the implemented code.
